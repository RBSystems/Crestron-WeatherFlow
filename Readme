The Crestron module pulls observation data from a Weatherflow smart weather station using the Weatherflow Rest API
Data is pulled every 15 minutes.  Outputs from the module include stings (formatted for display) of the data elements,
Analog values of the data elements (some of them scaled by 10 or 100 so accuracy isn't lost), and digital outputs that
indicate which elements were successfully extracted from the weather station and which weren't.
